APP_MSG
=======

Testing APP_MSG from Pebble smartwatch to phone

This tool can also be used as example of sending accelerometer data to phone, and reconstructing them on the phone side.

Notes: 
- It does not include resending of data in case of fail.
- It works with nearly zero loss at 50Hz, and small loss at 100Hz(4 msg sends/sec)
